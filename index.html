    <p>Some say it's crazy, some say it's just fine, but the truth of the matter is just that; the truth. Although this exercise is called <em>My First Website</em>, experts say Squid has done this before!</p>
    <p>It wasn't easy as this is a very fast squid who is hard to catch but we managed to reach out and have some words with the n00b-programmer-cephalopod</p>
    <p>"Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit." shared Squidderina. "Provident doloribus, fugiat impedit id illo <strong> donuts please </strong>, corporis quae dolore officia architecto facere incidunt delectus assumenda animi quis laborum vero aspernatur, a ipsa?"</p>
    <p>We weren't entirely sure what she was saying but it seemed relevant.</p>
    <p>Our team has reached out to Squidderina's fiance and monkeyman Mihai Monkeyman for further explanation but have received no response to date.</p>
